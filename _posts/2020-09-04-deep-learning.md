Practical aspects of deep learning.

## 1.Train/Dev/Test sets
### 1.1 Basic rules for spliting datasets  
train/test: 70% / 30%  
train/dev/test: 60% / 20% / 20%  
Big data era (like 1,000,000 examples): 98 / 1 / 1 or 99.5 / 0.4 / 0.1  

### 1.2 Mismatched train/test distribution
For example,  
- Training set: cat pictures from webpages  
- Dev/test set: cat pictures from users using apps  

**Make sure dev and test come from the same distribution.**  
**Not having a test set might be okay. (only dev set.)**

## 2.Bias/Variance
